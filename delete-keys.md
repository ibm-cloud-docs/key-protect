# Deleting keys using a single authorization
{: #delete-keys}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} to delete an
encryption key and its contents, if you are a manager for your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance.
{: shortdesc}

When you delete a key, you shred its contents and associated data. Any data that
is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible.
[Destroying resources](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-compliance#data-deletion)
is not recommended for production environments, but might be useful for
temporary environments such as testing or QA.
{: important}

Keep in mind the following considerations before you delete a key:

- {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} blocks the deletion of any key
that's actively protecting a cloud resource. Before you delete a key,
[review the resources](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources)
that are associated with the key.
- You can
[force deletion on a key](#delete-key-force)
that's protecting a cloud resource. However, the action won't succeed if the
key's associated resource is non-erasable due to a retention policy. You can
verify whether a key is associated with a non-erasable resource by
[checking the registration details](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources#view-protected-resources-api)
for the key. Then, you must contact an account owner to remove the retention
policy on each resource that is associated with the key before you can delete
the key.

## Deleting keys in the console
{: #delete-key-gui}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} requires one
authorization to delete a key. If you prefer to delete your encryption keys by
using a graphical interface, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
console.

[After you create or import your existing keys into the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-root-keys),
complete the following steps to delete a key:

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){: external}.

2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.

3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your
   provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

4. On the application details page, use the **Keys** table to browse the keys in
   your service.

5. Click the â‹¯ icon to open a list of options for the key that you want to
   delete.

6. From the options menu, click **Delete key** and confirm the key deletion in
   the next screen.

After you delete a key, the key transitions to the _Destroyed_ state. Keys in
this state are no longer recoverable. Metadata that is associated with the key,
such as the key's deletion date, is kept in the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} database.

## Deleting keys with the API
{: #delete-key-api}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} requires one
authorization to delete a key. You can delete a key and its contents by making a
`DELETE` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>
```

This action won't succeed if the key is actively protecting one or more cloud
resources. You can
[review the resources](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources)
that are associated with the key, or
[use the `force` parameter](#delete-key-force)
at query time to delete the key.
{: important}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Retrieve the ID of the key that you want to delete.

    You can find the ID for a key in your
    {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by
    [retrieving a list of your keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-keys),
    or by accessing the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
    dashboard.

3. Run the following `curl` command to delete the key and its contents.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X DELETE \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
        -H "prefer: <return_preference>"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following
    table.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Description</th>

          <p>
            When you set the <em>return_preference</em> variable to
            <code>return=minimal</code>, the service returns a successful
            deletion response. When you set the variable to
            <code>return=representation</code>, the service returns both the key
            material and the key metadata.

    </table>

    If the `return_preference` variable is set to `return=representation`, the
    details of the `DELETE` request are returned in the response entity-body.

    After you delete a key, it transitions to the `Deactivated` key state. After
    24 hours, if a key is not reinstated, the key transitions to the `Destroyed`
    state. The key contents are permanently erased and no longer accessible.

### Using the `force` query parameter
{: #delete-key-force}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} blocks the deletion of a key
that's protecting a cloud resource, such as a Cloud Object Storage bucket. You
can force delete a key and its contents by making a `DELETE` call to the
following endpoint.

```
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>?force=true
```

When you delete a key that has registrations associated with it, you shred the
key's contents and associated data. Any data that is encrypted by the key
becomes inaccessible.
{: note}

This action won't succeed if the key is protecting a resource that's
non-erasable due to a retention policy. You can verify whether a key is
associated with a non-erasable resource by
[checking the registration details](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources)
for the key. Then, you must contact an account owner to remove the retention
policy on each resource that is associated with the key before you can delete
the key.
{: important}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Retrieve the ID of the key that you want to force delete.

    You can retrieve the ID for a specified key by making a `GET /v2/keys/`
    request, or by viewing your keys in the
    {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard.

3. Run the following `curl` command to force delete the key and its contents.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X DELETE \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>?force=true" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
        -H "prefer: <return_preference>"
    ```
    {: codeblock}
