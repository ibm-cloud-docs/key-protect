# Rewrapping keys
{: #rewrap-keys}

Reencrypt your data encryption keys by using the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong}} API.
{: shortdesc}

When you
[rotate a root key in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-rotation),
new cryptographic key material becomes available for protecting the data
encryption keys (DEKs) that are associated with the root key. With the rewrap
API, you can reencrypt or rewrap your DEKs without exposing the keys in their
plaintext form.

To learn how envelope encryption helps you control the security of at rest data
in the cloud, see
[Protecting data with envelope encryption](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).

## Rewrapping keys by using the API
{: #rewrap-key-api}

You can reencrypt a specified data encryption key (DEK) with a root key that you
manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, without exposing the
DEK in its plaintext form.

Rewrapping keys works by combining `unwrap` and `wrap` calls to the service. For
example, you can emulate a `rewrap` operation by first calling the `unwrap` API
to access a DEK, and then calling the `wrap` API to reencrypt the DEK by using
the newest root key material.
{: note}

[After you rotate a root key in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-rotate-keys),
rewrap a data encryption key that is associated with the root key by making a
`POST` call to the following endpoint.

```plaintext
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/actions/rewrap
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your service and authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Copy the ID of the rotated root key that you used to perform the initial wrap
   request.

    You can retrieve the ID for a key by making a `GET api/v2/keys` request, or
    by viewing your keys in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
    GUI.

3. Copy the `ciphertext` value that was returned during the latest wrap request.

4. Rewrap the key with the latest root key material by running the following
   `curl` command.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X POST \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/actions/rewrap" \
        -H "accept: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key_action+json" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
        -H "content-type: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key_action+json" \
        -H "correlation-id: <correlation_ID>" \
        -d '{
                "ciphertext": "<encrypted_data_key>",
                "aad": [
                    "<additional_data>",
                    "<additional_data>"
                ]
            }'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following
    table.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Description</th>

            AAD, save the data to a secure location to ensure that you can
            access and provide the same AAD during subsequent unwrap or rewrap
            requests.

    The newly wrapped data encryption key, original key version (`keyVersion`)
    that is associated with the supplied ciphertext and latest key version
    (`rewrappedKeyVersion`) associated with the new ciphertext is returned in
    the response entity-body. The following JSON object shows an example
    returned value.

    ```json
    {
        "ciphertext": "eyJjaX ... h0Ijoi ... c1ZCJ9",
        "keyVersion": {
            "id": "02fd6835-6001-4482-a892-13bd2085f75d"
        },
        "rewrappedKeyVersion": {
            "id": "12e8c9c2-a162-472d-b7d6-8b9a86b815a6"
        }
    }
    ```
    {: screen}

    Store and use the new `ciphertext` value for future envelope encryption
    operations so that your data is protected by the latest root key.
