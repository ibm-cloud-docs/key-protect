# High availability and disaster recovery
{: #ha-dr}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} is a highly available, regional
service with automatic features that help keep your applications secure and
operational.
{: shortdesc}

Use this page to learn more about
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
availability and disaster recovery strategies.

## Locations, tenancy, and availability
{: #availability}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} is a multi-tenant, regional
service.

You can create {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} resources in one
of the supported
[{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} regions](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-regions),
which represent the geographic area where your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} requests are handled and
processed. Each {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region contains
[multiple availability zones](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/06/expansion-availability-zones-global-regions/){: external}
to meet local access, low latency, and security requirements for the region.

As you plan your encryption at rest strategy with
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, keep in mind that provisioning
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} in a region that is nearest to
you is more likely to result in faster, more reliable connections when you
interact with the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} APIs.

Choose a specific region if the users, apps, or services that depend on a
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} resource are geographically
concentrated. Remember that users and services who are far away from the region
might experience higher latency.

Your encryption keys are confined to the region that you create them in.
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} does not copy or export
encryption keys to other regions.
{: note}

If you import a root key into {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}},
you are encouraged to maintain a secure backup of the key material so that you
can restore the root key if it is accidentally deleted.

You can securely backup your root keys by creating a duplicate key with the same
key material for every imported root key within your instance. Each duplicate
key should be created in a {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
region that is different from the original key.

Note that every time a root key is rotated, new key material is added to the
key, which creates a new version of the key. Also, in case of accidental
deletion of one of those root keys, the software using that root key should be
capable of switching to the backup root key.

Two root keys that have the same key material can unwrap any data encryption
keys (DEKs) created by either of root key.

## Application-level High-Availability
{: #application-level-high-availability}

Applications that communicate over networks are subject to transient faults. You
should design your application to interact with Key Protect by using modern
resiliency techniques, such as Exponential backoff.
[Exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff){: external}
is a technique that retries requests exponentially, with increasing delays
between each request.

### Example Algorithm
{: #example-backoff-algorithm}

There are many approaches to implementing retries with exponential backoff
logic. Your approach will depend on your specific use case and the network
conditions surrounding your application. The following is an example
implementation of incremental retry delay.

```go
const maxRetries = 3
attempt := 1
delay := time.Second * 1
var ok bool
for !ok && attempt <= maxRetries {
    ok = makeRequest()
    if !ok {
        time.Sleep(delay)
        delay = delay * 2
        attempt += 1
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}

Once the maximum amount of retries has been reached and you have confirmed that
the errors your application is experiencing are due to
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, open a
[support ticket](https://github.ibm.com/kms/customer-issues){: external}
with details regarding your request.

## Disaster recovery
{: #dr}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} follows
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} requirements for
[planning and recovering from disaster events](/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#disaster-recovery){: external}.

To find out more about the responsibilities that you and IBM share for disaster
recovery, see
[Understanding your responsibilities with using {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-shared-responsibilities#disaster-recovery).
