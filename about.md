# Service overview
{: #about}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} helps you provision encrypted
keys for apps across {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. As you manage
the lifecycle of your keys, you can benefit from knowing that your keys are
secured by FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified cloud-based hardware security modules
(HSMs) that protect against the theft of information.

## Reasons to use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
{: #use-cases}

You might need to manage keys in the following scenarios:

| Scenarios | Reasons |
| --------- | ------- |
| As an IT admin for a large corporation, you need to integrate, track, and rotate encryption keys for many different service offerings. | The {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} interface simplifies the management of multiple encryption services. With the service, you can manage and sort encryption keys in one centralized location, or you can separate keys by project and house them in different {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} spaces. |
| As a developer, you want to integrate your pre-existing applications, such as self-encrypting storage, to {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. | Apps on or outside {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} can integrate with the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} APIs. You can use your own existing keys for your apps. |
| Your development team has stringent policies, and you need a way to generate and rotate keys every 30 days. | With {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, you can rapidly generate keys from an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} hardware security module (HSM). When it's time to replace a key, you can [rotate the key on-demand](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-rotate-keys) or [set a rotation policy](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-rotation-policy) for the key to meet your on-going security needs. |
| You are a security admin in an industry, such as finance or legal, that must adhere to governance over how data is protected. You need to grant controlled access of keys without compromising the data that it secures. | With the service, you can control user access to manage keys by [assigning different Identity and Access Management roles](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access#roles). For example, you can grant read-only access to users who need to view key creation information without viewing the key material. |
| You want to perform envelope encryption as you move data into the cloud. You need to bring your own master encryption keys, so you can manage and protect other keys that encrypt your data at rest. | With {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, you can [wrap (encrypt) your data encryption keys with a highly secure root key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption). You can bring your own root keys or create them in the service. |

customer-controlled, cloud-based hardware security modules (HSMs)?

## How {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} works
{: #kp-how}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong_notm}} helps you manage encryption
keys throughout your organization by aligning with
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.

An IT or security admin needs advanced permissions that an auditor might not. To
simplify access, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} maps to
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management roles so that
each role has a different view of the service. To help guide which view and
level of access best suits your needs, see
[Managing users and access](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access#roles).

The following diagram shows how managers, readers, and writers can interact with
keys that are managed in the service.
