# Getting started tutorial
{: #getting-started-tutorial}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} helps you provision encrypted
keys for apps across {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. This tutorial
shows you how to create and add existing cryptographic keys by using the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, so you can manage
data encryption from one central location.
{: shortdesc}

## Getting started with encryption keys
{: #get-started-keys}

From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, you can
create new keys for cryptography, or you can import your existing keys.

Choose from two key types:

<dl>
  <dt>
    Root keys
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Root keys are symmetric key-wrapping keys that you fully manage in
    {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. You can use a root key to
    protect other cryptographic keys with advanced encryption. To learn more,
    see
    [Protecting data with envelope encryption](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Standard keys
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Standard keys are symmetric keys that are used for cryptography. You can use
    a standard key to directly encrypt and decrypt data.
  </dd>
</dl>

## Creating new keys
{: #create-keys}

[After you create an instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-provision),
you're ready to designate keys in the service.

Complete the following steps to create your first cryptographic key.

1. On the application details page, click **Manage** &gt; **Add key**.

2. To create a new key, select the **Create a key** window.

    Specify the key's details:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Setting</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Name
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>
            A human-readable alias for easy identification of your key. Length
            must be within 2 - 90 characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            To protect your privacy, ensure that the key name does not contain
            personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or
            location.
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Key type
        </td>
        <td>
          The
          [type of key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption#key-types)
          that you would like to manage in
          {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">
        Table 1. Description of the <b>Create a key</b> settings
      </caption>
    </table>

3. When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Create key** to
   confirm.

Keys that are created in the service are symmetric 256-bit keys, supported by
the AES-CBC-PAD algorithm. For added security, keys are generated by FIPS 140-2
Level 3 certified hardware security modules (HSMs) that are located in secure
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers.

## Importing your own keys
{: #import-keys}

You can enable the security benefits of Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) by introducing
your existing keys to the service.

Complete the following steps to add an existing key.

1. On the application details page, click **Manage** &gt; **Add key**.

2. To upload an existing key, select the **Import your own key** window.

    Specify the key's details:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Setting</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Name
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>
            A human-readable alias for easy identification of your key. Length
            must be within 2 - 90 characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            To protect your privacy, ensure that the key name does not contain
            personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or
            location.
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Key type
        </td>
        <td>
          The
          [type of key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption#key-types)
          that you would like to manage in
          {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Key material
        </td>
        <td>
          The key material, such as a symmetric key, that you want to store in
          the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service. The key
          that you provide must be base64 encoded.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">
        Table 2. Description of the <b>Import your own key</b> settings
      </caption>
    </table>

3. When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Import key** to
   confirm.

From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, you can
inspect the general characteristics of your new keys.

You can programmatically enable an extra layer of protection to Bring Your Own
Key (BYOK) by encrypting your key material before you import a key into Key
Protect.

For more information about securely importing your keys, see
[Creating import tokens](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-import-tokens).

## What's next
{: #get-started-next-steps}

Now you can use your keys to code your apps and services. If you added a root
key to the service, you might want to learn more about using the root key to
protect the keys that encrypt your at-rest data. Check out
[Wrapping keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-wrap-keys) to get started.
