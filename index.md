# Getting started tutorial
{: #getting-started-tutorial}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} helps you provision or import encrypted keys for applications for many {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that can be managed from a central location. This tutorial shows you how to create and import existing cryptographic keys by using the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard.
{: shortdesc}

## Getting started with encryption keys
{: #get-started-keys}

From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, you can create new keys or import your existing keys.

Choose from two key types:

* **Root keys**: Symmetric keys that are used to protect other cryptographic keys with [envelope encryption](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption) that you fully manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

* **Standard keys**: Symmetric keys that are typically used to directly encrypt and decrypt data such as secrets and passwords.

While many of the topics in this documentation show how to accomplish tasks in both the console and with the APIs, check out [IBM Key Protect API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/key-protect){: external} for the API reference.
{: tip}

## Creating new keys
{: #create-keys}

[After you create an instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-provision), you're ready to create keys in the service. In this example, we'll create a root key.

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){: external}.

2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.

3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

4. To create a new key, click **Add**. A side panel will open. Make sure the **Create a key** option is selected.

    Specify the key's details:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Type | The [type of key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption#key-types) that you would like to manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. Root keys are selected by default.|
| Key name | A human-readable display name for easy identification of your key. Length must be within 2 - 90 characters (inclusive). To protect your privacy, ensure that the key name does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or location.|
| Key alias | **Optional**. [Key aliases](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-key-alias) are ways to describe a key that allow them to be identified and grouped beyond the limits of a display name. Keys can have up to five aliases.|
|Key ring| **Optional**. [Key rings](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-rings) are groupings of keys that allow those groupings to be managed independently as needed. Every key must be a part of a key ring. If no key ring is selected, keys are placed in the `default` key ring. Note that to place the key you're creating in a key ring, you must have the _Manager_ role over that key ring. For more information about roles, check out [Managing user access](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access).|

When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Create key** to confirm.

Keys that are created in the service are symmetric 256-bit keys, supported by the AES-CBC-PAD algorithm. For added security, keys are generated by FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified hardware security modules (HSMs) that are located in secure {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers.

For more information about creating root keys, check out [Creating root keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-root-keys).

For more information about creating standard keys, check out [Creating standard keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-standard-keys).

## Importing your own keys
{: #import-keys}

You can enable the security benefits of Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) by importing your existing keys to the service. In this example, we'll import a root key.

Complete the following steps to add an existing key.

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){: external}.

2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.

3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

4. To import a key, click **Add** and select the **Import your own key** window.

   Specify the key's details:

|Setting|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Key type|The [type of key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption#key-types) that you would like to manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. Select the **Root key** button.|
|Name|A human-readable alias for easy identification of your key. Length must be within 2 - 90 characters (inclusive). <br><br>To protect your privacy, ensure that the key name does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or location.|
|Key material|The base64-encoded key material, such as an existing key-wrapping key, that you want to store and manage in the service. For more information, check out [Base64 encoding your key material](#how-to-encode-root-key-material). Ensure that the key material is 16, 24, or 32 bytes long, and corresponds to 128, 192, or 256 bits in length. The key must also be base64-encoded.|
| Key alias | **Optional**. [Key aliases](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-key-alias) are ways to describe a key that allow them to be identified and grouped beyond the limits of a display name. Keys can have up to five aliases.|
|Key ring| **Optional**. [Key rings](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-rings) are groupings of keys that allow those groupings to be managed independently as needed. Every key must be a part of a key ring. If no key ring is selected, keys are placed in the `default` key ring. Note that to place the key you're creating in a key ring, you must have the _Manager_ role over that key ring. For more information about roles, check out [Managing user access](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access).|
{: caption="Table 1. Describes the Import your own key settings." caption-side="top"}

When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Import key** to confirm.

From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, you can inspect the general characteristics of your new keys.

You can programmatically enable an extra layer of protection to Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) by encrypting your key material before you import a key into {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

For more information about importing root keys, check out [Importing root keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-import-root-keys).

For more information about importing standard keys, check out [Importing standard keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-import-standard-keys).

## What's next
{: #get-started-next-steps}

Now you can use your keys to encrypt your apps and services. If you added a root key to the service, learn more about using the root key to protect the keys that encrypt your at rest data by checking out [Wrapping keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-wrap-keys).
