# Getting started tutorial
{: #getting-started-tutorial}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} helps you provision or import encrypted keys for applications for many {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that can be managed from a central location. This tutorial shows you how to create and import existing cryptographic keys by using the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard.
{: shortdesc}

## Getting started with encryption keys
{: #get-started-keys}

From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, you can create new keys or import your existing keys.

Choose from two key types:

* **Root keys**  
  Symmetric keys that are used to protect other cryptographic keys with [envelope encryption](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption) that you fully manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

* **Standard keys**  
  Symmetric keys that are typically used to directly encrypt and decrypt data like secrets and passwords.

## Creating new keys
{: #create-keys}

[After you create an instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-provision), you're ready to designate keys in the service.

Complete the following steps to create your first cryptographic key.

1. On the application details page, click **Manage key** and then **Add key**.

2. To create a new key, select the **Create a key** window.

Specify the key's details:

|Setting|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Name|A human-readable alias for easy identification of your key. Length must be within 2 - 90 characters (inclusive). To protect your privacy, ensure that the key name does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or location.|
|Key type|The [type of key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption#key-types) that you would like to manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.|
{: caption="Table 1. Description of the Create a key settings." caption-side="top"}

When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Create key** to confirm.

Keys that are created in the service are symmetric 256-bit keys, supported by the AES-CBC-PAD algorithm. For added security, keys are generated by FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified hardware security modules (HSMs) that are located in secure {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers.

## Importing your own keys
{: #import-keys}

You can enable the security benefits of Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) by importing your existing keys to the service.

Complete the following steps to add an existing key.

1. On the application details page, click **Manage key** and then **Add key**.

2. To upload an existing key, select the **Import your own key** window.

Specify the key's details:

|Setting|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Name|A human-readable alias for easy identification of your key. Length must be within 2 - 90 characters (inclusive). To protect your privacy, ensure that the key name does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or location.|
|Key type|The [type of key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption#key-types) that you would like to manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.|
|Key material|The key material that you want to store in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service. The key material that you provide must be base64 encoded.|
{: caption="Table 2. Description of the Import your own key settings." caption-side="top"}

When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Import key** to confirm.

From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, you can inspect the general characteristics of your new keys.

You can programmatically enable an extra layer of protection to Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) by encrypting your key material before you import a key into {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

For more information about securely importing your keys, see [Creating import tokens](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-import-tokens).

## What's next
{: #get-started-next-steps}

Now you can use your keys to encrypt your apps and services. If you added a root key to the service, learn more about using the root key to protect the keys that encrypt your at rest data by checking out [Wrapping keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-wrap-keys).

- To find out more about managing and protecting your encryption keys with a root key, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).

- To find out more about integrating the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service with other cloud data solutions, check out the [Integrations](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-integrate-services) documentation.

- To find out more about programmatically managing your keys, check out the [{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API reference](/apidocs/key-protect){: external} documentation.
