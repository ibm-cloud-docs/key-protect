# Viewing associations between root keys and encrypted {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources
{: #view-protected-resources}

You can view associations between root keys and other cloud resources, such as
Cloud Object Storage buckets or Cloud Databases deployments, by using the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong_notm}} API.
{: shortdesc}

When you use a root key to protect at rest data with envelope encryption, the
cloud services that use the key can create a registration between the key and
the resource that it protects.

Registrations are associations between keys and cloud resources that help you
get a full view of which encryption keys protect what data on
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

Key registration is an extra feature that's available only if the cloud service
has enabled it as part of its integration with
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. To determine whether an
[integrated service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-integrate-services)
supports key registration, refer to its service documentation for more
information.

{: #view-protected-resources-api}

You can browse the registrations that are available between your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} keys and cloud resources by
using the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API.

For example, when you call `GET api/v2/keys/{id}/registrations`,
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} returns details about the key
registration. The following JSON output represents a registration between a key
and a cloud resource.

```json

    The `resourceCrn` value represents the unique identifier of the cloud
    resource that is encrypted by `keyId`. The metadata that is associated with
    the registration, such as its creation date, is also returned in the
    response body.

    By default, `GET api/v2/keys/registrations` returns the first 200
    registrations, but you can adjust this limit by using the `limit` parameter
    at query time.
    {: note}

#### Filter registrations for a specific root key
{: #filter-registrations-specifc-key-api}

You can filter for a set of registrations that are associated with a root key
by specifying the `preventKeyDeletion` and `urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery`
parameters at query time.

For example, you might have 25 total registrations that are stored in your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance, but you only
want to retrieve registrations that have a retention policy that is associated
with a specific Cloud Resource Name (CRN).

You can use the following example request to retrieve a filtered set of
registrations.

```sh
$ curl -X GET \
    "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/registrations?preventKeyDeletion=<true|false>&urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery=<url_encoded_CRN>" \
    -H "accept: application/vnd.ibm.collection+json" \
    -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
    -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}

Replace the `preventKeyDeletion` and `urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery` variables in
your request according to the following table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <varname>preventKeyDeletion</varname>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        A boolean that filters registrations based on if a registered resource
        has a retention policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have multiple registrations in your instance, and
        you want to list only registrations where
        <code>preventKeyDeletion</code> is true, use
        <code>../registrations?preventKeyDeletion=true</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also pair <code>preventKeyDeletion</code> with
        <code>offest</code>, <code>limit</code>, and
        <code>urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery</code> to search through your available
        resources.
      </p>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <varname>urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery</varname>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        The resource CRN that you want to filter registrations by.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have multiple registrations in your instance, and
        you want to only view registrations that are associated with a
        specific Cloud Resource Name (CRN), use
        <code>
          ../registrations?urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery="url_encoded_CRN"

        [CRN query examples](#crn-query-examples).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also pair <code>urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery</code> with
        <code>offest</code>, <code>limit</code>, and
        <code>preventKeyDeletion</code> to search through your available
        resources.

  </tr>

  <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">

You can also filter for a subset of registrations by specifying the `limit` and
`offset` parameters at query time.

You can use the following example request to retrieve a filtered set of
registrations.

```sh
$ curl -X GET \
    "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/registrations?offset=<offset>&limit=<limit>" \
    -H "accept: application/vnd.ibm.collection+json" \
    -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
    -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>"

{: codeblock}

Replace the `limit` and `offset` variables in your request according to the
following table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <varname>offset</varname>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        The number of registrations to skip.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have 50 registrations in your instance, and you want
        to list registrations 26 - 50, use
        <code>../registrations?offset=25</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also pair <code>offset</code> with <code>limit</code> to page
        through your available resources.

    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <varname>limit</varname>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        The number of registrations to retrieve.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have 100 registrations in your instance, and you
        want to list only 10 registrations, use
        <code>../registrations?limit=10</code>. The maximum value for
        <code>limit</code> is 5000.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also pair <code>offset</code> with <code>limit</code> to page

#### Filter registrations for any root key
{: #filter-registrations-any-key-api}

You can filter for a set of registrations that are associated with any root key
managed in your provisioned instance of
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
by specifying the `preventKeyDeletion` and `urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery`
parameters at query time.

For example, you might have 25 total registrations that are stored in your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance, but you only
want to retrieve registrations that have a retention policy this is associated
with a specific Cloud Resource Name (CRN).

You can use the following example request to retrieve a specific set of
registrations.

```sh
$ curl -X GET \
    "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/registrations?preventKeyDeletion=<true|false>&urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery=<url_encoded_CRN>" \
    -H "accept: application/vnd.ibm.collection+json" \
    -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
    -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}

Replace the `preventKeyDeletion` and `urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery` variables in
your request according to the following table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <varname>preventKeyDeletion</varname>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        A boolean that filters registrations based on if a registered resource
        has a retention policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have multiple registrations in your instance, and
        you want to list only registrations where
        <code>preventKeyDeletion</code> is true, use
        <code>../registrations?preventKeyDeletion=true</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also pair <code>preventKeyDeletion</code> with
        <code>offest</code>, <code>limit</code>, and
        <code>urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery</code> to search through your
        available resources.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <varname>urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery</varname>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        The resource CRN that you want to filter registrations by.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have multiple registrations in your instance, and
        you want to only view registrations that are associated with a specific
        Cloud Resource Name (CRN), use
        <code>
          ../registrations?urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery="url_encoded_CRN"
        </code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information, see
        [CRN query examples](#crn-query-examples).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also pair <code>urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery</code> with
        <code>offest</code>, <code>limit</code>, and
        <code>preventKeyDeletion</code> to search through your available
        resources.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">
    Table 7. Describes the <code>preventKeyDeletion</code> and
    <code>urlEncodedResourceCRNQuery</code> variables.
  </caption>
</table>

You can also filter for a subset of registrations by specifying the `limit` and
`offset` parameters at query time.

You can use the following example request to retrieve a different set of
registrations.

```sh
$ curl -X GET \
    "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/registrations?offset=<offset>&limit=<limit>" \
    -H "accept: application/vnd.ibm.collection+json" \
    -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
    -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}

Replace the `limit` and `offset` variables in your request according to the
following table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <varname>offset</varname>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        The number of registrations to skip.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have 50 registrations in your instance, and you want
        to list registrations 26 - 50, use
        <code>../registrations?offset=25</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also pair <code>offset</code> with <code>limit</code> to page
        through your available resources.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <varname>limit</varname>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        The number of registrations to retrieve.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have 100 registrations in your instance, and you
        want to list only 10 registrations, use
        <code>../registrations?limit=10</code>. The maximum value for
        <code>limit</code> is 5000.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also pair <code>offset</code> with <code>limit</code> to page
        through your available resources.

### CRN query examples
{: #crn-query-examples}

Use URL encoded CRN queries to filter registrations by
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance, resource type, or
resource name. To learn more about CRN segments and format, see
[Cloud Resource Names](/docs/account?topic=account-crn){: external}.

Cloud Services that use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
to associate keys with resources on your behalf can only view or query for CRNs
that match the first 8 segments of their service CRN.
{: note}

- To search for the existence of a registration up to a specific CRN segment,
  use a colon followed by an asterisk (`*`).

    ```
    crn:v1:bluemix:public:databases-for-redis:us-south:a/
    274074dce64e9c423ffc238516c755e1:29caf0e7-120f-4da8-9551-3abf57ebcfc7:*:*
    ```
    {: screen}

    This query returns Databases for Redis registrations that are associated
    with all resource types and names for deployment ID
    _29caf0e7-120f-4da8-9551-3abf57ebcfc7_.

- To search for existence of a registration up to a specific CRN segment that's
  prefixed by `<string>`, use a colon followed by `<string>*` on the last
  segment of the CRN query.

  ```
  crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/e1bb63d6a20dc57c87501ac4c4c99dcb:*:bucket:prod*
  ```
  {: screen}

  This query returns all Cloud Object Storage bucket registrations within
  account _e1bb63d6a20dc57c87501ac4c4c99dcb_ that are prefixed by `prod`.

When
[listing registrations that are associated with any root key](/apidocs/key-protect#list-registrations-for-any-key){: external}, your CRN query should not contain an asterisk (*) in the first eight segments.
{: note}
