# Activity Tracker events
{: #at-events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the Activity Tracker
service to track how users and applications interact with
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} records service and user initiated activities
that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can
use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to
comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about
actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud
Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.

For more information regarding the Activity Tracker service, see the
[getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-getting-started){: external}.

To see which {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API requests
correlate to the actions below, check out the
[{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API reference doc](/apidocs/key-protect){: external}.

## Viewing events
{: #at-ui}

Events that are generated by an instance of
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} are automatically forwarded to
the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance that is available in the
same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To
view events, you must access the web UI of the
{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance is available. For more
information, see
[Launching the web UI through the IBM Cloud UI](/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-getting-started#gs_step4){: external}.

| Deployment Region | Activity Tracker Region |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `us-south`        | `us-south`              |
| `us-east`         | `us-east`               |
| `eu-gb`           | `eu-gb`                 |
| `eu-de`           | `eu-de`                 |
| `au-syd`          | `au-syd`                |
| `jp-tok`          | `jp-tok`                |
{: caption="Table 5. Activity Tracker regions" caption-side="top"}

## Analyzing successful events
{: #at-events-analyze}

Most successful requests have unique `requestData` and `responseData` associated
with each related event. The following sections describe the data of each
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service action event.

Fields are not guaranteed to appear unless the request is successful.
{: note}

### Common Fields
{: #at-events-common-fields}

There are some common fields that
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} uses outside of the CADF event
model to provide more insight into your data.

(CADF) event model, see
[Event Fields](/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-event){: external}

While `initiator.host.address` is a field that is part of the Cloud Auditing
Data Federation model, the host address field will not be shown for requests
made through private networks.

### Key action events
{: #key-action-events}

Due to the sensitivity of the information for an encryption key, when an event
is generated as a result of an API call to the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service, the event that is
generated does not include detailed information about the key, such as the
payload and encrypted nonce.

The `responseData.keyState` field is an integer and corresponds to the
Pre-activation = 0, Active = 1, Suspended = 2, Deactivated = 3, and Destroyed =
5 values. For more information on key states, see
[Key states and transitions](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-states#key-transitions).

## Analyzing failed events
{: #at-events-analyze-failed}

### Unable to delete a key
{: #delete-key-failure}

If the delete key event has a `reason.reasonCode` of 409, the key could not be
deleted because it is possibly protecting one or more cloud resources that have
a retention policy. Make a GET request to `/keys/{id}/registrations` to learn
which resources this key is associated with. A registration with
`"preventKeyDeletion": true` indicates that the associated resource has a
retention policy. To enable deletion, contact an account owner to remove the
retention policy on each resource that is associated with this key.

A delete key event could also receive a `reason.reasonCode` of 409 due to a dual
auth deletion policy on the key. Make a GET request to
`/api/v2/keys/{id}/policies` to see if there is a dual authorization policy
associated with your key. If there is a policy set, contact the other authorized
user to schedule the key for deletion.

### Unable to authenticate while make a request
{: #authenticate-failure}

If the event has a `reason.reasonCode` of 401, you do not have the correct
authorization to perform {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} actions
in the specified {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance.
Verify with an administrator that you are assigned the correct platform and
service access roles in the applicable service instance. For more information
about roles, see
[Roles and permissions](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access).

Check that you are using a valid token that is associated with an account
authorized to perform the service action.
{: note}

### Unable to view or list keys in a {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance
{: #list-keys-failure}

If you make a call to `GET api/v2/keys` to list the keys that are available in
your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance and
`responseData.totalResources` is 0, you may need to query for keys in the
deleted state using the `state` parameter or adjust the `offset` and `limit`
parameters in your request.

### Lifecycle action on a key with registrations did not complete
{: #protected-resource-key-failure}

The `responseData.reasonForFailure` and `responseData.resourceCRN` fields
contain information on why the action wasn't able to be completed.

If the event has a `reason.reasonCode` of 409, the action could not be completed
due to the adopting service's key state conflicting with the key state that
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} has.

If the event has a `reason.reasonCode` of 408, the action could not be completed
because {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} was not notified that
all appropriate actions were taken within 4 hours of the action request.

## Event Severity
{: #at-events-event-severity}

The severity for all Activity Tracker events with
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} are based on the type of request
that was made, then status code. For example, if you make a create key request
with an invalid key, but you are also unauthenticated for the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance that you included in
the request, the unauthentication will take precedence and the event will be
evaluated as a `401` bad request call with a severity of `critical`.

The following table lists the actions associated with each severity level:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Severity</th>
    <th>Actions</th>
