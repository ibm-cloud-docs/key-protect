The pricing model for {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} depends on either where the service is deployed or the disaster recovery capabilities it has, reflecting the differing use cases and infrastructure requirements of your deployments.
{: shortdesc}

If your instance is deployed in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} location, you are charged per account based on how many key versions you have in all of your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instances. If you have selected a plan that has enhanced cross-regional disaster recovery, you also are charged a flat monthly rate for each region where you have instances in addition to being charged double the key version rate. If you select a plan that does not have enhanced cross-regional support, you are not charged for instances.
