The pricing model for {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance depends on where the service is deployed and reflects the differing use cases and infrastructure requirements of cloud-based deployments compared to deployments into a user owned and managed infrastructure.
{: shortdesc}

If your instance is deployed in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} location (for example, in us-south), you are charged per account based on how many key versions you have combined in all of your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instances. You are not charged per instance. If the service is deployed into a user-managed Satellite location, you are charged a flat rate for the service (regardless of the number of instances) and an additional rate for the total allotment of keys (also known as your “quota”) you have selected for that location.
