# Deploying the Key Protect console to Satellite
{: #satellite-ui-deploy}

After you have [successfully deployed your Satellite location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-getting-started) and [configured your HSM](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-satellite-hsm-deploy), you're ready to deploy {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} on Satellite.
{: shortdesc}

While the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Console is used to create the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service on Satellite, the console itself cannot currently be used to access the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} APIs that are used to create keys or perform other key actions (such as rotating keys, deleting keys, editing keys, and so on). Those key actions must be performed through direct calls to the [{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} APIs](/apidocs/key-protect) or by using the CLI.
{: important}

## Before you begin
{: #satellite-ui-deploy-before-begin}

Before you can deploy {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} on Satellite, you must have created a Satellite location and have both deployed and [correctly configured](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-satellite-hsm-deploy) at least two HSMs. You must also have [gathered the information about the HSM that Satellite needs to consume](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-satellite-hsm-deploy#satellite-hsm-ui-values) and have [deployed the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Databases service in your Satellite location](docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-satellite-on-prem). You must also have been added to the allowlist, which can be achieved through your contact with the service representative.

Because the HSM information is not verified until after {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} has been provisioned (an operation that can take more than an hour), it is important to ensure these fields are filled out correctly when first attempting to create a {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} on Satellite location.
{: important}

* **HSM IP address**: The IP address of your HSM. This is needed in order to connect to the worker nodes that you assigned to {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.
* **HSM server certificate**: The NTLS communications used by the Thales HSM requires certificate exchanges between the HSM and {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. You must create a TLS certificate in your HSM and provide the certificate {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} will use to verify communications from the HSM.
* **Partition label**: The name of the partition that you created for {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} to use.
* **Partition crypto officer password**: The credential {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} needs to login to the relevant partition on the HSM to perform key operations.
* **Master key label**: {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} uses a Master Key Encryption Key in your partition. A label or name is assigned to this key and is used by {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} in PKCS#11 API to refer to the master key.
* **Signing key label**: A label or name for a key in a partition, which is used for data authentication such as data signing and verification.
* **Import key label**: {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} supports importing Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) by a DES3 encryption Key. A label or name is assigned to this key.
* **Secure import key label prefix (TKEK)**: {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} supports a secure mechanism to Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) into an HSM. The prefix used by the HSM for these keys must be known to {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.
* **Activity Tracker ingestions key**: To receive audit logs, you must create an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance and an ingestion key.

There are two additional credentials you must share before your service can be deployed, the **HSM client cert** and the **HSM client key**, but these are not shared as part of deploying the UI itself. These credentials enable NTLS communications used by the Thales HSM for exchanges between the HSM and {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} running on your worker node. You must create and register with the HSM a TLS certificate for the worker node (client) that will connect to the HSM and provide the client certificate and key that {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} uses to communicate with the HSM. The exact instructions to share these credentials are communicated as part of your conversations with your service representative.

## Provisioning {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
{: #satellite-ui-deploy-catalog}

To provision the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service, complete the following steps:

1. [Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/login/){: external}.

2. Click **Catalog** to view the list of services that are available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

3. Search for "Key Protect" in the ***Search the catalog...*** field and click `Key Protect`.

4. On the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} catalog page, select Satellite.

4. Note the **Before you begin** checklist and confirm you have completed the required steps.

5. Select the **Key quota** you want assigned to this location. This number represents the total number of keys which can be deployed into this location. This number can be changed later by opening a service ticket. Note that the quota can only be adjusted in groups of 100 keys. For more information, check out [Pricing for {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} on Satellite](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-pricing-plan-satellite). If you do not see the key quota section, the service plan, or the HSM fields, check with your service representative to make sure you have been added to the allowlist.

6. In the **Configure your resource** section:
    * Give the service a **Name**. While not necessary, it is a best practice to choose a name relevant to the usage you plan for the service.
    * Select a **Resource group**. By default the `Default` resource group will be chosen.
    * (Optional) Give the service a **Tag** (for example, `test`) or an **Access management tag**, which can help categorize the service.

7. Configure the HSMs the service will connect to. **Note that you must configure two HSMs**. To configure these HSMs, provide the HSM information you should have gathered [before you begin](#satellite-ui-deploy-before-begin).

8. After you have checked and double checked your HSM configuration information, click **Create** to provision {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. Note that the process of creating the database for the service can take more than an hour.

## Using the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service
{: #satellite-ui-deploy-use}

Now that {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} on Satellite has been successfully deployed, you're ready to use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} to encrypt your data at rest, which you can do using the the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} endpoint through the APIs.

* For information about how envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).

* To learn how to create root keys, check out [Creating root keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-root-keys).

* If you added a root key to the service, learn more about using the root key to protect the keys that encrypt your data at rest by checking out [Wrapping keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-wrap-keys).

* To find out more about authorizing other cloud services to integrate with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, check out the [Integrations](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-integrate-services) documentation.

* To find out more about programmatically managing your keys, check out the [{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API reference](/apidocs/key-protect){: external} documentation.
