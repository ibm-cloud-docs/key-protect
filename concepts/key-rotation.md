# Rotating encryption keys
{: #key-rotation}

Key rotation takes place when you retire a root key's original key material, and
you re-key it by generating new, cryptographic key material.

Rotating keys on a regular basis helps you meet industry standards and
cryptographic best practices. The following table describes the main benefits of
key rotation:

| Benefit | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Cryptoperiod management for keys | Key rotation limits how long your information is protected by a single key. By rotating your root keys at regular intervals, you also shorten the cryptoperiod of the keys. The longer the lifetime of an encryption key, the higher the probability for a security breach. |
| Incident mitigation | If your organization detects a security issue, you can immediately rotate the key to mitigate or reduce costs that are associated with key compromise. |
{: caption="Table 1. Describes the benefits of key rotation" caption-side="top"}

Key rotation is treated in the NIST Special Publication 800-57, Recommendation
for Key Management. To learn more, see
[NIST SP 800-57 Pt. 1 Rev. 4.](https://www.nist.gov/publications/recommendation-key-management-part-1-general-0){: external}

## Comparing your key rotation options in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
{: #compare-key-rotation-options}

In {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, you can
[set a rotation policy for a key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-rotation-policy)
or
[manually rotate the key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-rotate-keys).

Rotation options are available only for root keys.

  <dt>
    Setting a rotation policy for a key
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} helps you simplify
      rotation for encryption keys by enabling rotation policies for keys that
      you generate in the service. After you create a root key, you can manage
      a rotation policy for the key in the user interface (UI) or with the
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Choose an automatic rotation interval between 1 - 12 months for your key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-rotation#rotation-frequency)
      based on your on-going security needs. When it's time to rotate the key
      based on the rotation interval that you specify,
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} automatically replaces the
      key with new key material.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Rotating keys manually
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      As a security admin, you might want to have more control over the
      frequency of rotation for your keys. If you don't want to set an
      automatic rotation policy for a key, you can manually create a new key to
      replace an existing key, and then update your applications so that they
      reference the new key.
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify this process, you can use
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} to rotate the key
      on-demand. In this scenario,
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} creates and replaces the
      key on your behalf with each rotation request. The key retains the same
      metadata and key ID.

## How key rotation works
{: #how-key-rotation-works}

Key rotation works by securely transitioning key material from an _Active_ to a
_Deactivated_ key state. To replace the deactivated or retired key version, the
new key version moves into the _Active_ state and becomes available for
cryptographic operations.

### Using {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} to rotate keys
{: #use-key-protect-rotate-keys}

Keep in mind the following considerations as you prepare to use
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} for rotating root keys.

<dl>
  <dt>
    Rotating root keys that are generated in
    {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      You can use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} to rotate a
      root key that was generated in
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} by setting a rotation
      policy for the key, or by manually rotating the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The metadata for the root key, such as its key ID, does not change when
      you rotate the key.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Rotating root keys that you bring to the service
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      To rotate a root key that you initially imported to the service, you must
      generate and provide new key material for the key. You can use
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} to manually rotate
      imported root keys by supplying new key material as part of the rotation
      request.
    </p>
    <p>
      The metadata for the root key, such as its key ID, does not change when
      you rotate the key. Because you must provide new key material to rotate an
      imported key, automatic rotation policies are not available for root keys
      that have imported key material.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Managing retired key versions
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} creates a new version of
      the key with each rotation request. The service retires the old key
      versions and retains them until the root key is deleted. The retired key
      versions can no longer be used to wrap keys, but they remain available for
      unwrap operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} detects that you're
      using a retired key version to unwrap DEKs, the service provides a newly
      wrapped DEK that's based on the latest key version.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Monitoring key rotation activity in your account
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      After you rotate a root key,
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} notifies the
      {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data services that use the root key to
      protect your data. This notification triggers actions in those services to
      rewrap the key's associated data encryption keys (DEKs) with the latest
      key version.
    </p>
    <p>
      After {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} receives
      confirmation from those services that all associated DEKs are rewrapped,
      you receive an event in your Activity Tracker web UI to show that the
      rotation is complete.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

To enable key rotation options for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data
service, the data service must be integrated with
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. Refer to the documentation for
your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data service, or
[check out our list of integrated services to learn more](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-integrate-services).
{: note}

When you rotate a key in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, you're
not charged additional fees. You can continue to unwrap your wrapped data
encryption keys (WDEKs) with retired key material at no extra cost. For more
information about our pricing options, see the
[{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} catalog page](/catalog/services/key-protect){: external}.

### Understanding the key rotation process
{: #understand-key-rotation-process}

Behind the scenes, the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API
drives the key rotation process.

The following diagram shows a contextual view of the key rotation functionality.
![The diagram shows a contextual view of key rotation.](images/key-rotation.svg)
{: caption="Figure 1. Contextual view of key rotation." caption-side="bottom"}

With each rotation request, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
creates a new key version by associating new key material with your root key.

![The diagram shows a micro view the root key stack.](images/root-key-stack.svg)
{: caption="Figure 2. Micro view of a root key stack." caption-side="bottom"}

To learn how to use the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API to
rotate your root keys, see
[Rotating keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-rotate-keys).
{: tip}

### Rewrapping data after rotating a key
{: #rewrap-data-after-key-rotation}

After a rotation completes, a new key version becomes available for protecting
data encryption keys (DEKs) with
[envelope encryption](#x9860393){: term}.
Retired root key versions moves to the _Deactivated_ state, where they can only
be used to unwrap and access older DEKs that aren't yet protected by the latest
root key.

To secure your envelope encryption workflow,
[rewrap your DEKs](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-rewrap-keys)
 after you rotate a root key so that your at-rest data is protected by the
 newest root key.

Alternatively if {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} detects that
you're using retired key versions to unwrap a DEK, the service automatically
reencrypts the DEK and returns a wrapped data encryption key (WDEK) that's
based on the latest root key.

Store and use the new WDEK for future unwrap operations that the DEKs are
protected with the newest key version.

To learn how to use the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API to
rewrap data encryption keys, see
[Rewrapping keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-rewrap-keys).
{: tip}

## Frequency of key rotation
{: #rotation-frequency}

After you generate a root key in
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, you decide the frequency of its
rotation. You might want to rotate your keys due to personnel turnover, process
malfunction, or according to your organization's internal key expiration policy.

Rotate your keys regularly, for example every 30 days, to meet cryptographic
best practices.

| Rotation type | Frequency | Description |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| [Policy-based key rotation](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-rotation-policy) | Every 1 - 12 months | Choose a rotation interval between 1 - 12 months for your key based on your on-going security needs. After you set an rotation policy for a key, the clock starts immediately based on the initial creation date for the key. For example, if you set a monthly rotation policy for a key that you created on `2019/02/01`, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} automatically rotates the key on `2019/03/01`. |
| [Manual key rotation](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-rotate-keys) | Up to one rotation per hour | If you're manually rotating a key, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} allows one rotation per hour for each root key. |
