# Granting access to keys
{: #grant-access-keys}

You can enable different levels of access to
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong}} resources in your
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account by creating and modifying
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM access policies.
{: shortdesc}

As an account admin, determine an
[access policy type](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles#policytypes){: external}
for users, service IDs, and
[access groups](#x2160811){: term}
based on your internal access control requirements. For example, if you want to
grant user access to {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} at the
smallest scope available, you can
[assign access to a single key](#grant-access-key-level)
in an instance.

## Granting access to all keys in an instance
{: #grant-access-instance-level}

You can grant access to keys within a
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by using the
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

Review
[roles and permissions](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access)
to learn how {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM roles map to
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} actions.

## Granting access to a single key in an instance
{: #grant-access-key-level}

You can also assign access to a single key in a

Retrieve the unique identifer that's associated with the key that you want to
grant someone access to.

To get the ID for a specific key, you can:

- [Access the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} GUI](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-keys#view-keys-gui)
  to browse the keys that are stored in your
  {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance.

- [Use the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-keys#retrieve-keys-api)
  to retrieve a list of your keys, along with metadata about the keys.

### Step 2. Create an access policy
{: #access-key-create-policy}

Use the retrieved key ID to create a access policy:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select

2. Select a table row, and click the ⋯ icon to open a list of options for that
   user.

3. From the options menu, click **Assign access**.

4. Click **Assign users additional access**.

5. From the list of services, select
   **{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}**.

6. From the list of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instances,
   select the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance that
   contains the key that you want to grant access to.

7. Enter identifying information about the key.

   1. For **Resource type**, enter the word "key".

   2. For **Resource ID**, enter the ID that was assigned to your key by the
      {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service.

8. Choose a combination of
   [platform and service access roles](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access#roles)
   to assign access for the user.

9. Click **Add**.

10. Continue to add platform and service access roles as needed and when you are
