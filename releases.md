* Any and all types of keys (standard or root, imported or created) can be restored.
* It is no longer required to pass in key material when restoring a key.

For more information, check out [Restoring keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-restore-keys).

### Added: Updates to search by extractable content
{: #added-search-extractable}

Rotating keys and re-wrapping encrypted content with a new DEK is fundamental to security. Quickly retrieve keys having extractable content with [this search feature](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-keys#filter-keys-extractable-state-api).

### Added: Updates to the Key Protect UI
{: #upcoming-key-encrypt-ui}

New as of: 2021-02-15

Managing keys through the UI interface has been enhanced with new options presented in a simple and convenient selectable option menu within the context of each managed key. Simply click on the "overflow" icon  at the end of each row to access common features and UI enhancements.

Note that "Associated Resources" are now accessible within the context of each key in the console, as well as having its own item in the menu. Also, setting a key's rotation policy is now possible in the same panel where a key can be manually rotated.

Also, the list of endpoints in the console has grown with the addition of Osaka. You can now update your applications to reference the new endpoint.

### Added: Feature updates to the Key Protect UI
{: #upcoming-key-encrypt-ui}

New as of: 2021-02-15

The Key Protect UI now has support for the following feature:

Wrap/Unwrap (Envelope Encryption)
You can now use the Key Protect UI to wrap/unwrap active root keys. For more information, see Protecting data with envelope encryption for an overview, or check the documentation for how to wrap and unwrap your keys.

### Coming soon: Updates to key deletion functionality
{: #upcoming-key-deletion-changes}

Release Date: 2021-03-15

Beginning in April 2021, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
will implement a key purge feature that will automatically purge any keys that
have been deleted for more than 90 days. A purged key and its associated data
will be permanently removed, or hard deleted, from the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} database.

When a user or service deletes a key in Key Protect today, if the key is not
restored within 30 days, the key is soft deleted. All key data, except key
material data, remains in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, and
those details are retrievable by List Keys, Get Key and other APIs. Once
automatic key purge is introduced, users will not be able to retrieve any
information regarding a purged key. Any API calls that use the Key ID of a
purged key will result in a 404 HTTP Not Found error.

Note: A key purge can be reversed by restoring the hard deleted key.

- **How will the changes impact my environment?**
    The majority of users will not notice an impact. Please note that any data
    related to a purged key (key metadata, registrations, policies, etc) will no
    longer be available via the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
    service. If you are required to retain any data related to a purged key
    (key metadata, registrations, policies, etc) for an extended period of time,
    it is recommended to perform the necessary API or CLI calls to retrieve and
    store that data in your own storage device.

### Added: Updates to the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} UI
{: #february-2021-ui-updates}

New as of: 2021-02-05

If you have _Manager_ access permissions, you can filter for keys in the
**Destroyed** state and restore an imported root key via the â‹¯ icon on the
**Keys** table. You can use the restore key side panel to complete the
process for restoring the key.

For more information, see [Restoring a deleted key with the console](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-restore-keys#restore-ui).

### Added: {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} adds support for virtual private clouds
{: #added-private-endpoints}

New as of: 2021-02-05

You can now connect to {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} from your
virtual private cloud(VPC) via virtual private endpoint. VPEs are bound to a
[VPE gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe) and serve as an intermediary
that enables your workload to interact with
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

To get started, [provision a Virtual Private Cloud](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started){: external}
and create a [VPE gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ordering-endpoint-gateway){: external}. For more information, see

## February 2019
{: #feb-2019}

### Changed: Legacy {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instances
{: #changed-legacy-service-instances}

New as of: 2019-02-13

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instances that were
provisioned before 15 December 2017 are running on a legacy infrastructure that
is based on Cloud Foundry. This legacy
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service will be decommissioned
on 15 May 2019.

#### What this means to you
{: #feb-2019-what-this-means}

If you have active production keys in an older
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance, ensure that
you migrate the keys to a new instance by 15 May 2019 to avoid losing
access to your encrypted data. You can check to see whether you're using a
legacy instance by navigating to your resource list from the
[{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){: external}.

If your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance is
listed in the **Cloud Foundry Services** section of the
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, or if you're using a
`bluemix.net` API endpoint to target operations for
the service, you're using a legacy instance of the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. After 15 May 2019, the legacy
endpoint will no longer be accessible, and you won't be able to target the
service for operations.

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance? For detailed steps,
