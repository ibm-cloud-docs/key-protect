# Deleting keys using dual authorization
{: #delete-dual-auth-keys}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} to safely delete
encryption keys by using a dual authorization process.
{: shortdesc}

When you delete a key, you shred its contents and associated data. Any data that
is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible.
[Destroying resources](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-compliance#data-deletion)
is not recommended for production environments, but might be useful for
temporary environments such as testing or QA.
{: important}

Keep in mind the following considerations before you delete a key:

- {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} blocks the deletion of any key
that's actively protecting a cloud resource. Before you delete a key,
[review the resources](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources)
that are associated with the key.

- You can
[force deletion on a key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-delete-keys#delete-key-force)
that's protecting a cloud resource. However, the action won't succeed if the
key's associated resource is non-erasable due to a retention policy. You can
verify whether a key is associated with a non-erasable resource by
[checking the registration details](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources#view-protected-resources-api)
for the key.

## Deleting a key using dual authorization
{: #delete-dual-auth-keys-api}

Deleting a key that has a
[dual authorization policy](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-dual-auth)
requires an authorization from two users. With the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong_notm}} API, you can provide the
first authorization by
[setting the key for deletion](#set-key-deletion-api).
Then, a different user provides a second authorization by using the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} GUI or API to delete the key.

Before you delete a key by using dual authorization:

- **Determine who can authorize deletion of your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} resources.**
To use dual authorization, be sure to identify a user who can set the key for
deletion, and another user who can delete the key. Users with a _Writer_ or
 _Manager_ access policy can set keys for deletion. Users with a _Manager_
 access policy can delete keys.
- **Plan to delete the key within a 7-day waiting period.**
When the first user authorizes a key for deletion,
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} sets a 7-day waiting period on
the key. During this period, the key remains in the
[_Active_ state](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-states)
and all key operations are allowed on the key. To complete the deletion, the
second user with a _Manager_ access policy can use the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} GUI or API to delete the key.

### Authorize deletion for a key with the API
{: #set-key-deletion-api}

[After you enable dual authorization for an instance or key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-dual-auth),
you can provide the first authorization to delete a key by making a `POST` call
to the following endpoint.

```
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/actions/setKeyForDeletion
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

    To set a key for deletion, you must be assigned a _Manager_ or _Writer_
    access policy for the instance or key. To learn how IAM roles map to
    {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service actions, check out
    [Service access roles](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access#service-access-roles).
    {: note}

2. Copy the ID of the key that you want to set or authorize for deletion.

3. Provide the first authorization to delete the key.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X POST \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/actions/setKeyForDeletion" \
        -H "accept: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key_action+json" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
        -H "content-type: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key_action+json"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following

    A successful request returns an HTTP `204 No Content` response, which
    indicates that your key was authorized for deletion. Another user with a
    _Manager_ access policy can now
    [delete the key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-delete-keys)
    by using the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} GUI or API.

    If you need to prevent the deletion of a key that's already authorized for
    deletion, you can remove the existing authorization by calling
    `POST /api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/actions/unsetKeyForDeletion`.
    {: tip}

### Step 2. Delete the key
{: #delete-dual-auth-key-api}

After you set a key for deletion, a second user with a _Manager_ access policy
can safely delete the key by using the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} GUI or API.

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} sets a 7-day waiting period that
starts after you provide the first authorization to delete the key. During this
7-day period, the key remains in the
[_Active_ state](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-states)
and all key operations are allowed on the key. If no action is taken by the
second user and the 7-day period expires, you must
[restart the dual authorization process](#set-key-deletion-api)
 to delete the key.
{: note}

Delete a key and its contents by making a `DELETE` call to the following
endpoint.

```
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Retrieve the ID of the key that you would like to delete.

    You can retrieve the ID for a specified key by making a `GET /v2/keys`
    request, or by viewing your keys in the
    {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard.

3. Run the following cURL command to delete the key and its contents.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X DELETE \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
        -H "prefer: <return_preference>"
    ```

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following
    table.

    If the `return_preference` variable is set to `return=representation`, the
    details of the `DELETE` request are returned in the response entity-body.

    After you delete a key, it transitions to the `Deactivated` key state. After
    24 hours, if a key is not reinstated, the key transitions to the `Destroyed`
    state. The key contents are permanently erased and no longer accessible.

### Removing an existing authorization
{: #unset-key-deletion-api}

If you need to cancel an authorization for a key before the 7-day waiting period
expires, you can remove the existing authorization by making a `POST` call to
the following endpoint.
