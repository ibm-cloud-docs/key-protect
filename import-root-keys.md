# Importing root keys
{: #import-root-keys}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} to secure and manage your existing root keys by importing them.
{: shortdesc}

Root keys are symmetric key-wrapping keys that are used to protect the security of encrypted data in the cloud. For more information about importing root keys into {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, see [Bringing your encryption keys to the cloud](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-importing-keys).

Plan ahead for importing keys by [reviewing your options for creating and encrypting key material](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-importing-keys#plan-ahead). For added security, you can enable the secure import of the key material by using an [import token](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-importing-keys#using-import-tokens) to encrypt your key material before you bring it to the cloud.
{: note}

## Importing root keys with the console
{: #import-root-key-gui}
{: ui}

[After you create an instance of the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-provision), complete the following steps to import a key with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

If you enable [dual authorization settings for your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-dual-auth), keep in mind that any keys that you add to the service require an authorization from two users to delete keys.
{: note}

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){: external}.

2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.

3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

4. To import a key, click **Add** and select the **Import your own key** window.

   Specify the key's details:

|Setting|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Key type|The [type of key](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption#key-types) that you would like to manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. Select the **Root key** button.|
|Name|A human-readable alias for easy identification of your key. Length must be within 2 - 90 characters (inclusive). <br><br>To protect your privacy, ensure that the key name does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or location. Note that key names do not need to be unique.|
|Key material|The base64-encoded key material, such as an existing key-wrapping key, that you want to store and manage in the service. For more information, check out [Base64 encoding your key material](#how-to-encode-root-key-material). Ensure that the key material is 16, 24, or 32 bytes long, and corresponds to 128, 192, or 256 bits in length. The key must also be base64-encoded.|
| Key alias | **Optional**. [Key aliases](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-key-alias) are ways to describe a key that allow them to be identified and grouped beyond the limits of a display name. Keys can have up to five aliases.|
|Key ring| **Optional**. [Key rings](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-rings) are groupings of keys that allow those groupings to be managed independently as needed. Every key must be a part of a key ring. If no key ring is selected, keys are placed in the `default` key ring. Note that to place the key you're creating in a key ring, you must have the _Manager_ role over that key ring. For more information about roles, check out [Managing user access](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access).|
{: caption="Table 1. Describes the Import your own key settings." caption-side="top"}

When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Import key** to confirm.

If you know which key ring you want a key to be placed in, and you are a _Manager_ of that key ring, you can also navigate to the **Key rings** panel, select â‹¯ and click **Add key to key ring**. This will open the same panel you see by clicking **Add** on the **Keys** page with the **Key rings** variable filled in with the name of the key ring.

To protect the confidentiality of your personal data, avoid entering personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or location, when you add keys to the service.
{: important}

A successful `POST api/v2/keys` response returns the ID value for your key, along with other metadata. The ID is a unique identifier that is assigned to your key and is used for subsequent calls to the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API.

**Optional**: Verify that the key was added by running the following call to browse the keys in your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance.

```sh
$ curl -X GET \
    "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys" \

### Base64-encoding your key material
{: #how-to-encode-root-key-material}
{: api}

When importing an existing root key, it is required to include the encrypted key material that you want to store and manage in the service.

#### Using OpenSSL to encrypt existing key material
{: #open-ssl-encoding-root-import}
{: api}

Use this process to encrypt the contents of a key material in a file.

1. Download and install [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl#for-production-use){: external}.

2. Base64-encode your key material string by running the following command:

    ```sh
    openssl base64 -in <infile> -out <outfile>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following table.

|Variable|Description|
|--- |--- |
|infile|The name of the file where your key material string resides. Ensure that the key is 16, 24, or 32 bytes long, corresponding to 128, 192, or 256 bits in length. The key must be base64-encoded.|
|outfile|The name of the file where your base64-encoded key material will be created once the command has run.|
{: caption="Table 2. Describes the variables that are needed to base64-encode your key material." caption-side="top"}

If you want to output the base64 material in the command line directly rather than a file, issue `openssl enc -base64 <<< '<key_material_string>'`, where key_material_string is the key material input for your imported key.
{: note}

#### Using OpenSSL to create and encode new key material
{: #open-ssl-encoding-root-new-key-material}
{: api}

Use this process to create a random base64-encoded key material with a specific byte length. 32 bytes (256 bits) is recommended.

1. Download and install [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl#for-production-use){: external}.

2. Base64-encode your key material string by running the following command:

    ```sh
    openssl rand -base64 <byte_length>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Replace the variable in the example request according to the following
    table.

|Variable|Description|
|--- |--- |
|byte_length|The length of the key, measured in bytes. Acceptable byte lengths are 16, 24, or 32 bytes, corresponding to 128, 192, or 256 bits in length. The key must be base64-encoded.|
{: caption="Table 3. Describes the variable that is needed to create and encode new key material." caption-side="top"}

#### Key Material Creation Examples
{: #import-root-key-open-ssl-examples}

1. `openssl rand -base64 16` will generate a 128-bit key material.

2. `openssl rand -base64 24` will generate a 192-bit key material.

3. `openssl rand -base64 32` will generate a 256-bit key material.
