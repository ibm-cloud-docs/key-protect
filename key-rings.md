# Managing key rings
{: #restore-keys}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} to separate the keys in your service instance.
{: shortdesc}

As an account admin, you can separate the keys in your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} 
service instance into groups called `key rings`. Key rings are a container of keys 
that belong to your service instance. You can grant access to the key rings within a
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by using the
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

Before you create a key ring for your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance, keep in mind the
following considerations:

- **Pre-existing keys belong to the default key ring.**
  Each newly created {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} comes with a generated key ring 
  with an ID of `default`. All keys that are not associated with an otherwise specified key ring exists
  within the default key ring..

- **Key rings can hold standard and root keys.**
  Key rings can contain both standard and root keys. There is not a limit on how many keys can exist
  within a key ring.

- **A key can only belong to one key ring at a time.**
  A key can only belong to one key ring. Key ring assignment happens upon key creation. If a
  key ring id is not passed in upon creation, the key will belong to the default key ring.

- **It is not recommended to use key rings and fine grain policies within the same service instance.**


- **You should remove all keys from a key ring before deleting it.**


## Creating key rings with the API
{: #create-key-ring-api}

Create a key ring by making a `POST` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Create a key ring by running the following cURL command.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X POST \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/key_rings/<key_ring_id>" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
        -H "content-type: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json" \
        -H "correlation-id: <correlation_ID>" 
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following
    table.

## Granting access to a key ring
{: #grant-access-key-ring}

You can grant access to a key ring within a
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by using the
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

    that are available in your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service
    instance.

## Deleting key rings with the API
{: #delete-key-ring-api}

You can delete a key ring by making a
`DELETE` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/key_rings/<key_ring_id>
```

This action won't succeed if the key ring contains at least one key, regardless of key state. 
{: important}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Retrieve the ID of the key ring that you want to delete.

    You can find the ID for a key ring in your
    {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by
    [retrieving a list of your key rings](#list-key-ring-api).

3. Run the following cURL command to delete the key ring.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X DELETE \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/key_rings/<key_ring_ID>" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
