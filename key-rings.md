# Managing key rings
{: #managing-key-rings}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} to separate the keys
in your service instance.
{: shortdesc}

As an account admin, you can separate the keys in your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service instance into groups
called `key rings`. Key rings are a collection of keys that belong to your
service instance. You can grant access to the key rings within a
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by using the
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. You can provide different access
policies per key ring, for example, you can allow access group A to only view one key
ring in your service instance and allow access group B to have access to all of the key 
rings in your instance.

Before you create a key ring for your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance, keep in mind the
following considerations:

- **Every {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance comes with a default key ring.**
  Each newly created {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance comes with
  a generated key ring with an ID of `default`. All keys that are not associated
  with an otherwise specified key ring exists within the default key ring.

- **Key rings can hold standard and root keys.**
  Key rings can contain both standard and root keys. There is not a limit on how
  many keys can exist within a key ring.

- **A key can only belong to one key ring at a time.**
  A key can only belong to one key ring. Key ring assignment happens upon key
  creation. If a key ring id is not passed in upon creation, the key will belong
  to the default key ring.

- **It's not recommended to apply both the keyRing and resource/resourceType attributes on a single IAM policy.**
  When creating IAM access policies, it is recommended that you specify at most either a key ring ID or
  a resource ID.

## Creating key rings with the API
{: #create-key-ring-api}

Create a key ring by making a `POST` call to the following endpoint.

```plaintext
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Create a key ring by running the following `curl` command.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X POST \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/key_rings/<key_ring_id>" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
        -H "correlation-id: <correlation_ID>"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following
    table.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>

    A successful `POST api/v2/key_rings` request returns an HTTP `201 Created` 
    response, which indicates that the key ring was created and is now
    available for to hold standard and root keys.

The maximum amount of key rings is 50 per service instance.
{: note}

## Granting access to a key ring
{: #grant-access-key-ring}

You can grant access to a key ring within a
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by using the
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, 
[IAM API](/apidocs/iam-policy-management#create-policy){: external}, 
or [CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_user_policy_create){ :external}.

Review
[roles and permissions](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access)
to learn how {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM roles map to
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} actions.
{: tip}

To assign access to a key ring via console:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select
   **Users** to browse the existing users in your account.

2. Select a table row, and click the â‹¯ icon to open a list of options for that
   user.

3. From the options menu, click **Assign access**.

4. Click **Assign users additional access**.

5. Click the **IAM services** button.

6. From the list of services, select
   **{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}**.

7. Select **Services based on attributes**.

8. Select the **Instance ID** attribute and select the instance in which the key
   ring resides.

9. Select the **Key Ring ID** attribute and enter the ID associated with the key ring.

8. Choose a combination of
   [platform and service access roles](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access#roles)
   to assign access for the user.

9. Click **Add**.

10. Continue to add platform and service access roles as needed and when you are
    finished, click **Assign**. Note that the user must be assigned at least _Reader_ 
    access to the entire instance in order for them to access the key ring. This instance 
    level access policy will be separate from the key ring access policy.

## Listing key rings with the API
{: #list-key-ring-api}

For a high-level view, you can browse the key rings that are managed in your
provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} by
making a GET call to the following endpoint.

This action won't succeed if the key ring contains at least one key, regardless
