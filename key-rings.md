# Managing key rings
{: #restore-keys}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} to seperate the keys in your service instance.
{: shortdesc}

As an account admin, you can separate the keys in your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} 
service instance into groups called `key rings`. Key rings are a container of keys 
that belong to your service instance. You can grant access to the key rings within a
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by using the
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

Before you create a key ring for your
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance, keep in mind the
following considerations:

- **Pre-existing keys belong to the default key ring.**
  Each {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} comes with a default key ring. The default
  key ring will hold all keys that existed prior to key ring assignment.

- **Key rings can hold standard and root keys.**
  Key rings can contain both standard and root keys.

- **A key can only belong to one key ring at a time.**
  A key can only belong to one key ring. Key ring assignment happens upon key creation. If a
  key ring id is not passed in upon creation, the key will belong to the default key ring.

- **It is not recommended to use key rings and fine grain policies within the same service instance.**
  A key can only belong to one key ring. Key ring assignment happens upon key creation. If a
  key ring id is not passed in upon creation, the key will belong to the default key ring.


## Creating key rings with the API
{: #create-key-ring-api}

Create a key ring by making a `POST` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Create a key ring by running the following cURL command.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X POST \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
        -H "content-type: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json" \
        -H "correlation-id: <correlation_ID>" \
        -d '{
                "metadata": {
                    "collectionType": "application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json",
                    "collectionTotal": 1
                },
                "resources": [
                    {
                        "type": "application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json",
                         "name": "<key_alias>",
                         "description": "<key_description>",
                         "expirationDate": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSZ>",
                         "extractable": <key_type>
                    }
                ]
            }'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following
    table.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Description</th>

            resides.

          key does not expire.

## Granting access to a key ring
{: #grant-access-key-ring}

You can grant access to a key ring within a
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by using the
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

Review
[roles and permissions](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access)
to learn how {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM roles map to
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} actions.
{: tip}

To assign access:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select
   **Users** to browse the existing users in your account.
2. Select a table row, and click the â‹¯ icon to open a list of options for that
   user.
3. From the options menu, click **Assign access**.
4. Click **Assign users additional access**.
5. Click the **IAM services** button.
6. From the list of services, select
   **{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}**.
7. From the list of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instances,
   select a {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance that you
   want to grant access to.
8. Choose a combination of
   [platform and service access roles](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access#roles)
   to assign access for the user.
9. Click **Add**.
10. Continue to add platform and service access roles as needed and when you are
    finished, click **Assign**.
