# Architecture and workload isolation
{: #compute-isolation}

Review the sample architecture and compute isolation characteristics for
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong}}.

## {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} architecture
{: #architecture}

The following architecture diagram shows how
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} components work to protect your
sensitive data and keys.

Access to the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service takes
place over HTTPS. All communication uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2
protocol to encrypt data in transit.
{: note}

| Components | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} REST API | The {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} REST API drives encryption key creation and management across {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. |
| IBM-managed hardware security module | Behind the scenes, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers provide the hardware to protect your keys. Hardware security modules (HSMs) are tamper-resistant hardware devices that store and use cryptographic key material without exposing keys outside of a cryptographic boundary. All cryptographic operations, such as key creation and key rotation, are performed within the HSM. IBM periodically rotates the HSM's master keys, which provides an extra layer of security. |
| Customer-managed encryption keys | Root keys are symmetric key-wrapping keys that protect data encryption keys with [envelope encryption](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption). Root keys never leave the boundary of the hardware security module. |
| Dedicated key storage | Key metadata is stored in highly durable, dedicated storage for {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} that is encrypted at rest with additional application layer encryption. |

## {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} workload isolation
{: #workload-isolation}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} is a multi-tenant, regional
service that supports the following workload isolation characteristics:

- {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} resources are isolated within
a secure runtime environment that is shared across an
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} multi-zone region.
- Multiple instances of the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
service run on shared clusters and a shared container.
- To isolate workloads, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
processes API requests within a security context that is user-based and unique
to each customer.
