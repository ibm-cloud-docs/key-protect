# Unwrapping keys
{: #unwrap-keys}

You can unwrap a data encryption key to access its contents by using the
{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} API. Unwrapping a DEK decrypts
and checks the integrity of its contents, returning the original key material to
your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data service.
{: shortdesc}

To learn how key wrapping helps you control the security of at-rest data in the
cloud, see
[Protecting data with envelope encryption](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).
{: tip}

## Unwrapping keys by using the API
{: #unwrap-key-api}

[After you make a wrap call to the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-wrap-keys),
you can unwrap a specified data encryption key (DEK) to access its contents by
making a `POST` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_id>?action=unwrap
```
{: codeblock}

Root keys that contain the same key material can unwrap the same data encryption
key (WDEK).
{: note}

1. [Retrieve your service and authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Copy the ID of the root key that you used to perform the initial wrap
   request.

  You can find the ID for a key in your
  {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by
  [retrieving a list of your keys](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-keys),
  or by accessing the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard.

3. Copy the `ciphertext` value that was returned during the initial wrap
   request.

4. Run the following cURL command to decrypt and authenticate the key material.

    ```sh
    $ curl -X POST \
        "https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>?action=unwrap" \
        -H "accept: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key_action+json" \
        -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
        -H "content-type: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key_action+json" \
        -H "correlation-id: <correlation_ID>" \
        -d '{
                "ciphertext": "<encrypted_data_key>",
                "aad": [
                    "<additional_data>",
                    "<additional_data>"
                ]
            }'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following
    table.

    </table>

    The original key material is returned in the response entity-body. The
    response body also contains the ID of the key version that was used to
    unwrap the supplied ciphertext.

    The plaintext that is returned is base64 encoded. For more information on
    how to decode your key material, see
    [Decoding your key material](#how-to-decode-key-material).
    The following JSON object shows an example returned value.

    ```json
    {
        "plaintext": "Rm91ciBzY29yZSBhbmQgc2V2ZW4geWVhcnMgYWdv",
        "keyVersion": {
            "id": "02fd6835-6001-4482-a892-13bd2085f75d"
        }
    }
    ```

    If {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} detects that you rotated
    the root key that is used to unwrap and access your data, the service also
    returns a newly wrapped data encryption key (`ciphertext`) in the unwrap
    response body. The latest key version (`rewrappedKeyVersion`) that is
    associated with the new `ciphertext` is also returned. Store and use the new
    `ciphertext` value for future envelope encryption operations so that your
    data is protected by the latest root key.

## Decoding your key material
{: #how-to-decode-key-material}

When you unwrap a data encryption key, the key material is returned in base64
encoding. You will need to decode the key before encrypting it.

### Using OpenSSL to decode key material
{: #open-ssl-encoding-root-unwrap}

1. Download and install
   [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl#for-production-use){: external}.

2. Base64 encode your key material string by running the following command:

    ```sh
    openssl base64 -d -in <infile> -out <outfile>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following
    table.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <varname>infile</varname>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>
            The name of the file where your base64 encoded key material string
            resides.
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <varname>outfile</varname>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>
            The name of the file where your decoded key material will be be
            outputted once the command has ran.
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">
        Table 3. Describes the variables that are needed to decode your key
        material.
      </caption>
    </table>

  If you want to output the decoded material in the command line directly rather
  than a file, run the command
  `openssl enc -base64 -d <<< '<key_material_string>'`, where
  key_material_string is the returned plaintext from your unwrap request.
